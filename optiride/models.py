class RiderBike:

    This class encapsulates all the physical parameters needed to model cycling
    performance, including mass, aerodynamics, rolling resistance, and power capabilities.

    Attributes:
        mass_rider_kg: Rider mass in kilograms.
        mass_bike_kg: Bike mass in kilograms.
        crr: Coefficient of rolling resistance (dimensionless, typically 0.002-0.005).
        cda: Aerodynamic drag area in mÂ² (CdA, typically 0.2-0.4 for road cycling).
        drivetrain_eff: Drivetrain efficiency (0-1, typically 0.95-0.98).
        cp: Critical Power in watts (sustained power threshold).
        w_prime_j: W' (W-prime) in joules, anaerobic work capacity above CP.
        ftp: Functional Threshold Power in watts (alternative to CP).
        age: Rider age in years (optional, for physiological calculations).
